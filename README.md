# Investigate-Gapminder-Datasets
In this repository, I investigated dataset from gapminder: tmdb movies dataset to answer some question related to these datasets with some visuals using "jupyter notebook" from [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) tools.

I wrote code with notes in file with ipynb (ipython notebook) extenison which can be opened by jupyter notebook. I also provided html version.
